# CNCF TAG Observability üî≠‚öôÔ∏è

Technical Advisory Group for Observability under the umbrella of [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/).

## Mission statement

The TAG Observability focuses on topics pertaining to the observation of cloud native workloads. Additionally, it produces
supporting material and best practices for end-users and provides guidance and coordination for CNCF projects working within the TAG‚Äôs scope.

### Scope

* Foster, review and grow the ecosystem of observability related projects, users, and maintainers in open source, cloud-native technology.
* Identify and report gaps in the CNCF's project portfolio on topics of observability to the TOC and the wider CNCF community.
* Collect, curate, champion, and disseminate patterns and current best practices related to the observation of cloud-native systems that are effective and actionable.
* Educate and inform users with unbiased, accurate, and pertinent information. Educate and help other CNCF projects regarding observability techniques and best current practices available within the CNCF.
* Provide and maintain a vendor-neutral venue for relevant thought validation, discussion, and project feedback.
* Provide a ladder for community members to become involved with the technical oversight of projects within the SIG's scope in an open, transparent, and inclusive way.
